## Graduation project for China Academy of Art
This is a archaic music game working with the college students of China Academy of Art.  
****
This project is still under maintenance and has not been completed yet.  
Some project assets are still missing, and there are new requirements changes in the near future.  
There are three scenes in the project at present, but the **Play Scene** has not well-communicated with other scenes because of the realization of core gameplay in the **Play Scene**
